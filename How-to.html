  <h2>Step 1: Search for Relevant Literature</h2>
  <p>In this context, literature just means any academic sources like books or journal articles about your topic.</p>
  <p>First, you need to search in the right scholarly databases, so something like Google Scholar, JSTOR, Science Direct.</p>
  <p>Search your keywords with Boolean operators like these to help you filter and refine the search results.</p>
  <p>Check out this video to find out how to use them.</p>

  <h2>Step 2: Evaluate and Select Sources</h2>
  <p>Evaluate and select sources. Unless your topic is super niche, you probably can not read EVERYTHING that is been written on the topic.</p>
  <p>Once you've got the sources from step 1, read the abstract to scan whether an article is relevant or not. Also scan the bibliography to find other relevant sources!</p>
  <p>You should also pay attention to the citation count on Google Scholar. If the count is high, the source is probably important and you should include it.</p>

  <h2>Step 3: Identify Themes, Debates, and Gaps</h2>
  <p>Identify themes, debates, and gaps. As you read, take notes and pay attention to the connections between different sources.</p>
  <p>This way, you can organize your literature review's arguments and structure a lot easier. Here are some things to look for: </p>
  <p>Trends and patterns in theory, method or results, themes debates or contradictions, influential studies and gaps.</p>

  <h2>Step 4: Outline Your Literature Review's Structure</h2>
  <p>Outline your literature review's structure. You can go about your literature review's structure in a few ways.</p>
  <p>It all depends on what you found in the literature and what you want to emphasize.</p>
  <p>Here are 4 common approaches to structure the literature review:</p> 
  <p>Chronological, thematic, methodological, and theoretical. More details in this video, check it out.</p>

  <h2>Step 5: Get things done!</h2>
  <p>And finally, get writing! Make sure your literature review has an introduction, a main body that summarizes and synthesizes the sources, and a conclusion, just like other academic texts.</p>
